/// details | Why Signal Client?
Signal Client wraps signal-cli with a stable SDK, deployment guidance, and operational guardrails. Instead of stitching brittle scripts, you get:

- Versioned APIs that follow Signal schema updates.
- Repeatable deployment patterns for containers, edge devices, and TEEs.
- Tooling to triage failures, replay messages, and scale throughput safely.

When you need to bend Signal to your product, Signal Client gives you the batteries and the guardrails.
